## 🔍 About Me

I bring a unique blend of cross-industry expertise, from scaling travel content marketplaces to shaping healthcare and finance narratives — and from editing academic manuscripts to leading print editorial teams.

My editorial roots run deep:
- **Print publishing** at *Infomedia18* and *Netscribes*, where I crafted B2B editorial frameworks and set quality benchmarks. I also oversaw the end-to-end production and design of magazines across sectors including **food processing, retail, automation, manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics**.

- **Academic editing** at *Cactus Communications*, where I edited over 1,000 manuscripts across public health, nutrition, and economics, achieving a 99% acceptance rate in peer-reviewed journals.
- **Digital leadership** roles at *Headout*, *Flatworld Solutions*, and *Trivone*, where I led content operations, built high-performance teams, and drove measurable content performance.

## 💬 Editorial Philosophy

> "Scalable systems. Story-first strategy. Editorial integrity that never compromises clarity, intent, or quality."

I lead with empathy for both users and teams — mentoring writers, refining content journeys, and elevating brand voice across every medium. Whether it's academic rigor or conversion-driven storytelling, I believe strong editorial thinking is the engine behind every successful product or experience.
