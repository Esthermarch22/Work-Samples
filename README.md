## 🔍 About Me

I bring a unique blend of cross-industry expertise, from scaling travel content marketplaces to shaping healthcare and finance narratives — and from editing academic manuscripts to leading print editorial teams.

My editorial roots run deep:
- **Print publishing** at *Infomedia18* and *Netscribes*, where I crafted B2B editorial frameworks and set quality benchmarks.  
  I also oversaw the end-to-end production and design of magazines across sectors including **food processing, retail, automation, manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics**.
- **Academic editing** at *Cactus Communications*, where I edited over 1,000 manuscripts across public health, nutrition, and economics, achieving a 99% acceptance rate in peer-reviewed journals.
- **Digital leadership** at *Headout*, *Flatworld Solutions*, and *Trivone*, where I led content operations, built high-performance teams, and drove measurable content performance.  
  I also developed innovative tools like a **custom Word Cloud Tool** for large-scale SEO mapping and a **Supply Readiness Tree** that enabled better validation of content inputs across formats like cruises and guided tours.

## 🧠 Digital Leadership & Innovation

As a digital content leader, I focus on building systems that enable scale, reduce ambiguity, and support quality at speed. I combine content strategy with smart tooling and governance to drive outcomes across editorial, SEO, and product teams.

- 🛠️ **Created a Word Cloud Tool** to automate keyword visualizations across multiple product units. This helped identify content focus areas at scale, reduce writer guesswork, and align copy structure with top-ranking search patterns — especially for microbrand SEO strategies.
- 🌲 **Built a Supply Readiness Tree**, a decision-support system that helped non-editorial teams validate inclusions and exclusions for experience-based products. It introduced logic-based paths tailored for variable formats like cruises and walking tours, enabling better coverage accuracy and fewer errors at handoff.
- 📐 **Established content strategy and governance standards** that reduced editorial rework, improved tone consistency, and empowered writers to produce high-quality content autonomously. These systems raised compliance to 98%, improved time-to-publish, and supported high-volume delivery across formats.

## 💬 Editorial Philosophy

> "Scalable systems. Story-first strategy. Editorial integrity that never compromises clarity, intent, or quality."

I lead with empathy for both users and teams — mentoring writers, refining content journeys, and elevating brand voice across every medium. Whether it's academic rigor or conversion-driven storytelling, I believe strong editorial thinking is the engine behind every successful product or experience.
